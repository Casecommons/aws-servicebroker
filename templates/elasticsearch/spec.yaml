  longDescription: Amazon Elasticsearch Service is a fully managed service that makes it easy 
    for you to deploy, secure, and operate Elasticsearch at scale with zero down time. 
    The service offers open-source Elasticsearch APIs, managed Kibana, and integrations with 
    Logstash and other AWS Services, enabling you to securely ingest data from any source and 
    search, analyze, and visualize it in real time. Amazon Elasticsearch Service lets you pay 
    only for what you use â€“ there are no upfront costs or usage requirements. With Amazon 
    Elasticsearch Service, you get the ELK stack you need, without the operational overhead.
